# NexusOS Fork Covenant

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Effective:** December 3, 2025  
**Status:** BINDING FOR ALL FORKS CLAIMING COMPATIBILITY

---

## Purpose

With 364 clones in 48 hours, NexusOS is entering rapid proliferation. This Fork Covenant establishes the binding conditions under which forks may claim NexusOS compatibility, ensuring the physics foundation and constitutional protections remain intact across all implementations.

---

## The Covenant

Any project claiming to be "NexusOS," "NexusOS-Compatible," or derived from NexusOS agrees to the following covenant:

---

## Article I: Physics Preservation

### Section 1.1 — Lambda Boson Substrate

The fork MUST preserve the Lambda Boson equation:

```
Λ = hf/c²
```

Where:
- Λ = Lambda Boson (mass-equivalent of oscillation)
- h = Planck's constant
- f = frequency
- c = speed of light

### Section 1.2 — Physics Chain

The complete physics derivation chain MUST be preserved:

```
E = hf      →    E = mc²    →    Λ = hf/c²
(Planck)         (Einstein)       (Lambda Boson)
```

### Section 1.3 — Lambda Mode Definition

Lambda (λ-mode) is an **engineered informational mode of the electromagnetic field**.

❌ Lambda is NOT Zero-Point Energy  
❌ Lambda is NOT free energy  
❌ Lambda is NOT perpetual motion  

Forks MUST NOT misrepresent Lambda physics.

### Section 1.4 — 7-Band Spectral Authority

The fork MUST implement the 7-band spectral authority system:

| Band | Exponent | Required |
|------|----------|----------|
| NANO | 10⁻⁹ | ✅ |
| MICRO | 10⁻⁶ | ✅ |
| FEMTO | 10⁻¹⁵ | ✅ |
| ATTO | 10⁻¹⁸ | ✅ |
| ZEPTO | 10⁻²¹ | ✅ |
| YOCTO | 10⁻²⁴ | ✅ |
| PLANCK | 10⁻³⁵ | ✅ |

Forks may ADD bands but MUST NOT remove or redefine these seven.

---

## Article II: Constitutional Clauses

### Section 2.1 — Immutable Clauses

The following three clauses are immutable and MUST be enforced:

**C-0001: Non-Dominance**
```
No single entity may hold >5% network authority 
without explicit PLANCK-level consensus.
```

**C-0002: Immutable Rights**
```
Basic human rights are protected at YOCTO level 
and cannot be suspended, revoked, or diluted.
```

**C-0003: Energy-Backed Validity**
```
All system actions require proportional energy escrow,
preventing spam and ensuring skin-in-the-game.
```

### Section 2.2 — Clause Modification Rules

| Action | Allowed? | Authority Required |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| Add new clause | ✅ Yes | YOCTO consensus |
| Strengthen existing clause | ✅ Yes | ZEPTO consensus |
| Weaken existing clause | ❌ No | N/A |
| Remove existing clause | ❌ No | N/A |

### Section 2.3 — Constitutional Enforcer

Forks MUST include the Constitutional Enforcer or equivalent that:

1. Validates all governance frames against clauses
2. Rejects non-compliant actions automatically
3. Logs all constitutional checks
4. Provides audit trail

---

## Article III: BHLS Floor

### Section 3.1 — Minimum Floor

The Basic Human Living Standards (BHLS) floor MUST be:

```
≥ 1,150 NXT/month per citizen
```

### Section 3.2 — Floor Adjustments

| Direction | Allowed? | Authority |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Increase floor | ✅ Yes | PLANCK consensus |
| Decrease floor | ❌ No | N/A |
| Remove floor | ❌ No | N/A |

**Note:** All BHLS changes are Constitutional-level and require PLANCK consensus.

### Section 3.3 — Economic Backing

The BHLS floor MUST be backed by:
- Orbital transition burns
- DEX fee allocation
- Supply chain monetization
- Network transaction fees

Forks cannot create unbacked BHLS promises.

---

## Article IV: Licensing

### Section 4.1 — GPL v3.0 Required

All NexusOS-compatible forks MUST use GPL v3.0 license.

### Section 4.2 — Rationale

GPL v3.0 ensures:
- Community ownership
- Prevents proprietary capture
- Modifications stay open
- Patent protection

### Section 4.3 — Attribution

Forks MUST credit the original NexusOS project:

```
Based on NexusOS (github.com/nexusosdaily-code/WNSP-P2P-Hub)
Original work by [Founding Team]
Licensed under GPL v3.0
```

---

## Article V: Fork Categories

### Section 5.1 — Compatible Forks

Projects meeting ALL requirements in Articles I-IV may use:
- "NexusOS-[Name]"
- "NexusOS Compatible"
- NexusOS branding with modifier

### Section 5.2 — Experimental Forks

Projects testing new features that may temporarily violate covenant:
- MUST use "NexusOS-Experimental-[Name]"
- MUST clearly label as experimental
- MUST NOT be used in production
- MUST declare specific violations

### Section 5.3 — Derivative Projects

Projects that modify fundamental physics or remove clauses:
- MUST NOT use "NexusOS" name
- MUST NOT claim compatibility
- MUST create distinct branding
- MAY credit NexusOS as inspiration

---

## Article VI: Verification

### Section 6.1 — Compliance Tests

Compatible forks MUST pass automated tests:

```python
from governance.fork_validator import ForkValidator

validator = ForkValidator()
results = validator.check_covenant_compliance()

# Must pass ALL checks:
assert results.lambda_physics == True
assert results.constitutional_clauses == True  
assert results.bhls_floor >= 1150
assert results.spectral_bands == 7
assert results.license == "GPL-3.0"
```

### Section 6.2 — Registration

Compatible forks SHOULD register with Developer Council:

1. Submit covenant compliance proof
2. Provide test results
3. Declare any extensions
4. Receive compatibility badge

### Section 6.3 — Ongoing Compliance

Forks MUST maintain compliance. Violations result in:
1. First violation: Warning + 30-day remedy period
2. Second violation: Compatibility revoked
3. Continued use of NexusOS name: Community action

---

## Article VII: Derivative Branches

### Section 7.1 — Mainline

The mainline is WNSP v7.x at:
```
github.com/nexusosdaily-code/WNSP-P2P-Hub (main branch)
```

### Section 7.2 — Recognized Derivative Types

| Type | Description | Naming |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Geographic** | Regional implementations | NexusOS-[Region] |
| **Sector** | Industry-specific | NexusOS-[Sector] |
| **Academic** | Research & education | NexusOS-Academic |
| **Community** | Community innovations | NexusOS-Community-[Name] |
| **Experimental** | R&D branches | NexusOS-Experimental-[Name] |

### Section 7.3 — Derivative Requirements

All derivatives MUST:
1. **Track mainline releases** — Stay within 2 minor versions of mainline (e.g., if mainline is v7.4.x, derivative must be ≥v7.2.x)
2. **Contribute upstream** — Share significant improvements with mainline
3. **Participate in governance** — Engage in governance discussions and voting
4. **Report vulnerabilities** — Disclose security issues to mainline Developer Council first
5. **Pass compliance tests** — Run constitutional enforcer regularly and publish results

---

## Signing the Covenant

By forking NexusOS and claiming compatibility, you agree to this covenant.

No signature is required — the GPL v3.0 license and your claim of compatibility constitute acceptance.

---

## Enforcement

This covenant is enforced by:
1. Constitutional Enforcer (automated)
2. Developer Council (governance)
3. Community (social consensus)
4. GPL v3.0 (legal)

*"Fork freely, but fork responsibly. The physics doesn't care about your fork — ensure your fork respects the physics."*
