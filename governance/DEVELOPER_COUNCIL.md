# NexusOS Developer Council & Community Governance

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Effective:** December 2025  
**License:** GPL v3.0 — Community Owned, Physics Governed

---

## Purpose

As NexusOS enters the public domain, forks will emerge. This document establishes expectations, standards, and governance structures to ensure the Lambda Boson substrate remains coherent across implementations while allowing innovation.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Physics Cannot Be Forked
The Lambda Boson equation (Λ = hf/c²) is derived from Nobel Prize-winning physics. Any fork claiming NexusOS compatibility MUST preserve:

- **E = hf** (Planck's relation)
- **E = mc²** (Einstein's mass-energy equivalence)  
- **Λ = hf/c²** (Lambda Boson mass-equivalent)

Forks that modify these equations are **not NexusOS-compatible** and must use a different name.

### 2. Constitutional Clauses Are Immutable
The three constitutional clauses CANNOT be removed or weakened in any NexusOS-compatible fork:

| Clause | Name | Protection Level |
|--------|------|------------------|
| C-0001 | Non-Dominance | No entity >5% authority without PLANCK consensus |
| C-0002 | Immutable Rights | Basic rights protected at YOCTO level |
| C-0003 | Energy-Backed Validity | All actions require proportional energy escrow |

Forks may ADD clauses but cannot REMOVE or WEAKEN these three.

### 3. BHLS Floor Is Sacred
The Basic Human Living Standards floor (currently 1,150 NXT/month) represents the minimum guarantee of human dignity. Forks may:
- ✅ INCREASE the BHLS floor
- ❌ DECREASE the BHLS floor
- ❌ REMOVE the BHLS system

---

## Developer Council Structure

### Founding Council (Genesis Phase)
During the Genesis Phase (first 2 years), the Founding Council consists of:

1. **Protocol Architect** — Original system designer
2. **Physics Validator** — Ensures Lambda Boson correctness
3. **Constitutional Guardian** — Monitors clause enforcement
4. **Community Representative** — Voice of the user community
5. **Security Auditor** — Threat detection and response

### Transition to Decentralized Governance
After Genesis Phase, council seats become elected positions using spectral authority voting:

- **NANO-FEMTO voters** — Elect Community Representative
- **ATTO-ZEPTO validators** — Elect Security Auditor  
- **YOCTO-PLANCK holders** — Elect Protocol Architect, Physics Validator, Constitutional Guardian

### Council Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility | Authority Level |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| Protocol Architect | Core substrate changes | PLANCK required |
| Physics Validator | Lambda equation integrity | YOCTO required |
| Constitutional Guardian | Clause enforcement | YOCTO required |
| Community Representative | User advocacy | ATTO required |
| Security Auditor | Threat response | ZEPTO required |

## Fork Guidelines

### Compatible Fork Requirements
To be recognized as "NexusOS Compatible," a fork MUST:

1. ✅ Preserve Lambda Boson physics (Λ = hf/c²)
2. ✅ Implement all three constitutional clauses
3. ✅ Maintain BHLS floor at or above 1,150 NXT/month
4. ✅ Use 7-band spectral authority (NANO → PLANCK)
5. ✅ Include GPL v3.0 license
6. ✅ Credit original NexusOS project
7. ✅ Pass constitutional enforcer tests

### Fork Naming Convention
- **Compatible forks:** May use "NexusOS" with modifier (e.g., "NexusOS Mars Edition")
- **Incompatible forks:** MUST NOT use "NexusOS" name
- **Experimental branches:** Use "NexusOS-Experimental-[name]"

### Fork Registration
Compatible forks should register with the Developer Council by:

1. Submitting proof of constitutional compliance
2. Passing automated Lambda physics tests
3. Demonstrating BHLS implementation
4. Agreeing to the Fork Covenant (below)

---

## Fork Covenant

By forking NexusOS, developers agree to:

```
THE NEXUSOS FORK COVENANT

I/We, as fork maintainers, covenant to:

1. PRESERVE the Lambda Boson substrate (Λ = hf/c²) without modification
2. ENFORCE the three constitutional clauses automatically
3. PROTECT the BHLS floor from reduction or removal
4. CREDIT the original NexusOS project and contributors
5. MAINTAIN GPL v3.0 licensing for all derivative works
6. REPORT security vulnerabilities to the Developer Council
7. INTEROPERATE with the main NexusOS network when possible

We understand that violation of this covenant removes our fork's
"NexusOS Compatible" status and may result in community sanctions.

Fork Name: _____________________________

## Protocol Upgrade Process

### Proposal Categories

| Category | Authority Required | Voting Period | Examples |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|----------|
| **Micro** | ATTO consensus | 3 days | Typos, documentation |
| **Minor** | ATTO consensus | 7 days | Bug fixes, optimizations |
| **Standard** | ZEPTO consensus | 14 days | New features, API changes |
| **Major** | YOCTO consensus | 30 days | Spectral band changes, new clauses |
| **Constitutional** | PLANCK consensus | 90 days | Clause modifications, BHLS changes |

**Note:** See UPGRADE_PROTOCOL.md for full upgrade lifecycle details.

### Upgrade Lifecycle

1. **Proposal** — Submit via governance API with energy escrow
2. **Discussion** — 14-day community review period
3. **Voting** — Spectral authority weighted voting
4. **Implementation** — Developer Council oversees integration
5. **Deployment** — Phased rollout with rollback capability

### Emergency Upgrades
Security-critical fixes may bypass normal process with:
- Security Auditor approval
- Constitutional Guardian verification
- 72-hour expedited voting at ZEPTO level
- Immediate deployment to affected nodes
