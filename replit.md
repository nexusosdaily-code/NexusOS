# NexusOS Civilization Operating System

## Overview
NexusOS is a civilization architecture that replaces traditional binary computation with electromagnetic wave states and bases its economics on quantum energy (E=hf). Its core purpose is to build a self-sustaining, physics-based civilization that guarantees basic living standards through a Basic Human Living Standards (BHLS) floor system, ensuring prosperity and stability. A key feature is the Economic Loop System, a 5-milestone economic architecture where messaging burns create economic value through orbital transitions, DEX liquidity allocation, supply chain monetization, community ownership, and crisis protection.

## User Preferences
-   **Communication Style**: Simple, everyday language
-   **Technical Approach**: Physics-first, quantum-inspired economics
-   **Architecture**: Wavelength-based validation over traditional cryptographic hashing
-   **Licensing**: GPL v3 (GNU General Public License v3.0) to ensure community ownership and prevent corporate exploitation

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The system provides a Unified Dashboard Launcher (`app.py`) offering access to multiple modules. The **Mobile Blockchain Hub** (`mobile_blockchain_hub.py`) serves as the central blockchain interface, integrating all core blockchain operations into a unified mobile-first application including a Web3 Wallet, Mobile DAG Messaging, Blockchain Explorer, DEX, Validator Economics, Wavelength Economics, Network modules, Civic Governance, and Mobile Connectivity.
