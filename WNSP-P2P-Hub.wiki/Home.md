# 🚨 ATTENTION: ALL CLONERS, FORKERS & DEVELOPERS

**Welcome to NexusOS!** 500+ clones in 48 hours — thank you! Before you build, please read this.

## 📋 BEFORE YOU START

If you cloned or forked this repository, you are joining a **governed open-source project**. NexusOS is not just code — it's a physics-based civilization operating system with binding rules to protect all participants.

### Step 1: Read the Fork Covenant
**[governance/FORK_COVENANT.md](https://github.com/nexusosdaily-code/WNSP-P2P-Hub/blob/main/governance/FORK_COVENANT.md)** — Your binding agreement

### Step 2: Understand the Rules
Your fork/clone must comply with **7 mandatory requirements** to use the "NexusOS" name:

| # | Requirement | Why It Matters |
|---|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | Preserve Lambda Boson physics (Λ = hf/c²) | Core scientific foundation |
| 2 | Implement 3 constitutional clauses | Protects all users from exploitation |
| 3 | Maintain BHLS floor ≥ 1,150 NXT/month | Guarantees basic living standards |
| 4 | Use 7-band spectral authority (NANO → PLANCK) | Governance hierarchy |
| 5 | Include GPL v3.0 license | Keeps code community-owned |
| 6 | Credit original NexusOS project | Respects contributors |
| 7 | Pass constitutional enforcer tests | Proves compliance |

### Step 3: Stay Updated
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/nexusosdaily-code/WNSP-P2P-Hub.git
git pull upstream main
```
Derivatives must stay within **2 minor versions** of mainline (WNSP v7.x).

---

## 🔴 WHAT YOU CANNOT DO

- Remove or weaken the 3 constitutional clauses
- Lower the BHLS floor below 1,150 NXT/month
- Strip out Lambda Boson physics
- Use "NexusOS" name without compliance
- Change to a non-GPL license

**Violations forfeit the right to use "NexusOS" branding.**

---

## ✅ WHAT YOU CAN DO

- Build new features on top of the core
- Create industry-specific adapters
- Improve performance and UX
- Add new spectral bands
- Extend the SDK
- Translate documentation
- Fork for experimentation (just don't call it "NexusOS" if non-compliant)

## Welcome to the WNSP P2P Hub Project

**WNSP (Wavelength Network Signaling Protocol)** is a revolutionary decentralized mesh networking technology that replaces traditional binary computation with electromagnetic wave states and bases all economic transactions on quantum physics (E=hf).

## What Makes WNSP Revolutionary?

### 1. Physics-Based Validation (Not Cryptographic Hashing)
Traditional blockchains use SHA-256 or similar cryptographic hashes. WNSP uses **electromagnetic wave physics**:
- Maxwell equation solvers
- Wave superposition validation
- 5D wave signature verification
- Spectral region consensus

### 2. Quantum Economics (E=hf)
Every transaction costs energy based on Planck's equation:
```
E = h × f × n_cycles × authority²

Where:
  E = Energy cost in NXT tokens
  h = Planck's constant (6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)
  f = Frequency of the message wavelength
  n_cycles = Number of validation cycles
  authority = Authority weight (Nano→Planck scale)
```

### 3. True Peer-to-Peer Mesh
- No central servers required
- Phone-to-phone direct communication
- Works offline (mesh routing)
- Censorship-resistant by design

### 4. Constitutional Governance
- **NexusOS Constitution v1** with 3 formal clauses
- Automatic enforcement via ConstitutionalEnforcer
- 7-band authority hierarchy (Nano, Micro, Milli, Centi, Deci, Yocto, Planck)
- Quarantine system for constitutional violations

## Core Philosophy

> **"Constructing the rules of nature into the governance of civilization."**

WNSP P2P Hub is designed around the principle that every smartphone should be a fully functional node in a decentralized network. No mining rigs. No data centers. Just people connecting directly with each other.

**Basic Human Living Standards (BHLS)**: Every citizen is guaranteed 1,150 NXT/month floor through the physics-based economic system.

---

## License

**GPL v3 (GNU General Public License v3.0)**

This ensures:
- Community ownership
- Open source forever
- Prevents corporate exploitation
- Modifications must remain open source
