# NexusOS Terms and Conditions

**Version 1.0 | Effective Date: November 2025**

---

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to NexusOS, a physics-based civilization operating system built on the principle: *"Constructing the rules of nature into the governance of civilization."*

By participating in the NexusOS network as a user, validator, or delegator, you agree to these Terms and Conditions.

---

## 2. Native Token (NXT)

### 2.1 Token Supply
- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000 NXT (fixed, non-inflationary base)
- **Smallest Unit**: 1 NXT = 100,000,000 units (similar to Bitcoin satoshis)

### 2.2 Token Purpose
NXT is the native utility token used for:
- Transaction fees (based on E=hf physics pricing)
- Validator staking and delegation
- Governance voting
- Access to ecosystem services (DEX, farming, lottery, supply chain pools)

---

## 3. Validator Staking Rules

### 3.1 Whale Protection Policy

To ensure network decentralization and prevent monopolization, the following staking limits are enforced:

| Parameter | Limit | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Minimum Validator Stake** | 1,000 NXT | Ensures committed, serious validators |
| **Maximum Validator Stake** | 10,000 NXT | 1% of total supply - prevents single-entity dominance |
| **Minimum Delegation** | 10 NXT | Low barrier for community participation |
| **Maximum Delegations per Validator** | 50,000 NXT | 5% cap prevents mega-validator centralization |

### 3.2 Decentralization Guarantee

These limits ensure:
- **Minimum 100 validators** required to stake the entire supply
- No single validator can control more than **6% of network stake** (10,000 self + 50,000 delegated)
- Governance voting power is capped at **10%** per validator regardless of stake

### 3.3 Multiple Validators

Users may operate multiple validator nodes, subject to:
- Each validator requires a separate wallet address
- Each validator must independently maintain uptime and performance
- Each validator is subject to individual slashing and reputation scoring
- This design ensures that large stakeholders bear proportional operational responsibility

---

## 4. Validator Responsibilities

### 4.1 Performance Requirements
Validators must maintain:
- **Uptime**: Minimum 95% availability
- **Block Production**: Timely proposal and validation of blocks
- **Network Participation**: Active participation in consensus

### 4.2 Slashing Penalties

Violations result in stake slashing:

| Offense | Penalty |
|---------|---------|
| Extended Downtime | 1% of stake |
| Double Signing | 5% of stake |
| Malicious Block Proposal | 10% of stake |
| Byzantine Behavior | 20% of stake |
| Network Attack Participation | 100% of stake |

### 4.3 Jailing

Validators may be temporarily "jailed" (removed from active set) for:
- Default jail period: 24 hours
- Repeated offenses may result in permanent exclusion

---

## 5. Delegation Terms

### 5.1 Delegator Rights
- Delegators earn proportional rewards based on stake contribution
- Delegators may undelegate at any time (subject to unbonding period)
- Delegators share in slashing penalties proportional to their delegation

### 5.2 Unbonding Period
- **Duration**: 7 days
- During unbonding, funds do not earn rewards
