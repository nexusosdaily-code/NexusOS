## Fork Covenant — 7 Mandatory Requirements

Any fork claiming "NexusOS Compatible" MUST:

1. **Preserve Lambda Boson physics** (Λ = hf/c²)
2. **Implement all 3 constitutional clauses** (Non-Dominance, Immutable Rights, Energy-Backed Validity)
3. **Maintain BHLS floor** ≥ 1,150 NXT/month
4. **Use 7-band spectral authority** (NANO → PLANCK)
5. **Include GPL v3.0 license**
6. **Credit original NexusOS project**
7. **Pass constitutional enforcer tests**

**Forks that violate these requirements MUST NOT use the "NexusOS" name.**

---

## Mainline Definition

**WNSP v7.x** is the canonical mainline:
- Repository: `github.com/nexusosdaily-code/WNSP-P2P-Hub`
- Branch: `main`
- Status: MAINNET READY

Derivatives must stay within 2 minor versions of mainline.

## Important Notes

- **Lambda (λ-mode)** is an engineered informational mode of the electromagnetic field — NOT Zero-Point Energy
- **BHLS floor** can only be increased, never decreased (PLANCK consensus required)
- **Constitutional clauses** cannot be removed or weakened
- **GPL v3.0** ensures community ownership
