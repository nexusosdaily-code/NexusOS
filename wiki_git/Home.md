# WNSP P2P Hub - GitHub Wiki

## Welcome to the WNSP P2P Hub Project

**WNSP (Wavelength Network Signaling Protocol)** is a revolutionary decentralized mesh networking technology that replaces traditional binary computation with electromagnetic wave states and bases all economic transactions on quantum physics (E=hf).

## What Makes WNSP Revolutionary?

### 1. Physics-Based Validation (Not Cryptographic Hashing)
Traditional blockchains use SHA-256 or similar cryptographic hashes. WNSP uses **electromagnetic wave physics**:
- Maxwell equation solvers
- Wave superposition validation
- 5D wave signature verification
- Spectral region consensus

### 2. Quantum Economics (E=hf)
Every transaction costs energy based on Planck's equation:
```
E = h × f × n_cycles × authority²

Where:
  E = Energy cost in NXT tokens
  h = Planck's constant (6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)
  f = Frequency of the message wavelength
  n_cycles = Number of validation cycles
  authority = Authority weight (Nano→Planck scale)
```

### 3. True Peer-to-Peer Mesh
- No central servers required
- Phone-to-phone direct communication
- Works offline (mesh routing)
- Censorship-resistant by design

### 4. Constitutional Governance
- **NexusOS Constitution v1** with 3 formal clauses
- Automatic enforcement via ConstitutionalEnforcer
- 7-band authority hierarchy (Nano, Micro, Milli, Centi, Deci, Yocto, Planck)
- Quarantine system for constitutional violations

## Core Philosophy

> **"Constructing the rules of nature into the governance of civilization."**

WNSP P2P Hub is designed around the principle that every smartphone should be a fully functional node in a decentralized network. No mining rigs. No data centers. Just people connecting directly with each other.

**Basic Human Living Standards (BHLS)**: Every citizen is guaranteed 1,150 NXT/month floor through the physics-based economic system.

**GPL v3 (GNU General Public License v3.0)**

This ensures:
- Community ownership
- Open source forever
- Prevents corporate exploitation
- Modifications must remain open source
