Course Description

This course introduces students to the physical basis of communication in the universe, exploring how electromagnetic fields, quantum dynamics, and wave interactions encode and transfer information. Students will learn the underlying principles of spectral identity, wave modulation, interference logic, and emergent information structures, and will study how these principles can be used to build next-generation communication systems such as Wavelength Native Signalling Protocols (WNSP).

The course blends physics, engineering, information theory, and systems science, culminating in a capstone project designing a physics-aligned communication system.

🎯 Course Learning Outcomes
